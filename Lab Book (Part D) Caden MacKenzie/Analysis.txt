n-Queens and Monte Carlo Estimate
Caden MacKenzie

In order to understand the backtracking algorithm for the n-queens problem it is first important to understand how many nodes are in a tree with n queens. This is given by the equation ((n^n+1)-1)/(n-1). The number of nodes in a tree with 8 queens would take an incredibly long time to check. Therefore the backtracking method must be implemented in order to only check those nodes with a promising node before it. Still, using only promising nodes creates problems due to the fact that there are n! promising nodes. When considering solutions, there are n^2 children for every node in a state space tree and therefore (n^2)^n leaves, or in other words solutions.

The Monte Carlo Estimate works by generating a random path as far down the tree as possible and storing that depth. By generating enough random paths and averaging them using the equation, an estimate is generated.

In my results the MCE was close to the number of nodes visited in the n-queens problem, however it was not spot on. With more tests in the MCE the number would maybe be closer to the true value.
